<p>
What all did i learn from love?<br>
It was amazing when it lasted,<br>
love is a very beautiful thing,<br>
<br>it taught me how to stay up<br>
all night,<br>how you cant move your body<br>
without her presence,<br>
it taught me another version <br>
of pain and smile,<br><br>their 
were dark days and <br>rainbow days,
<br>enjoyed both of them <br>with her,<br>
<br>her shyness my coolness,
<br>makes us 'Bittersweet',<br>
<br>Love as so much power to<br> endure your heart,
<br>I never knew, it messed up <br>and raised up 
my life<br><br>she has the energy to
<br> withdraw the pain,<br>and shaking all my<br> horror with her,<br>
in order to live
<br>
happily together...
